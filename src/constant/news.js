        content1: "Right now, Australia is being ravaged by one of the most devastating bushfire seasons the country has ever seen. So far, more than 10 million hectares of Australian land has been burned.",
        content2: "It’s estimated that as many as 8,400 koalas have perished in fires on the mid-north coast of NSW and Kangaroo Island in South Australia has lost over 50% of their koala population This is a devastating blow for an iconic species already in decline, and these bushfires have the potential to hasten koalas’ slide towards extinction in eastern Australia.",
        content3: "Koalas could be extinct in the wild in eastern Australia in as little as 30 years due mainly to ongoing excessive tree-clearing for agricultural and urban development and climate heating triggered bushfires that destroy koala habitat, that potentially accelerate the extinction timeline.",
